Welcome to the Ryot, the Rust canarY Open Tibia Framework, a robust and versatile suite of Rust crates and applications
designed specifically for
developing tiled 2D games.
Inspired by the mechanics and perspectives of games like Open Tibia and Tibia, Ryot offers specialized tools for
creating top-down 45-degree perspective games.

## Crates

- **[Ryot][ryot]**: Serves as the central gateway to the framework, providing essential plugins, bundles, and a unified
  API to
  streamline game development with Bevy.
- **[Ryot Assets][ryot_assets]**: Manages asset loading and processing.
- **[Ryot Core][ryot_core]**: Provides foundational components and systems crucial for all other functionalities.
- **[Ryot Internal][ryot_internal]**: Includes utilities for internal use within the framework.
- **[Ryot Pathfinder][ryot_pathfinder]**: Offers pathfinding functionalities tailored for Bevy 2D.
- **[Ryot Ray Casting][ryot_ray_casting]**: Offers ray casting functionalities tailored for Bevy 2D.
- **[Ryot Sprites][ryot_sprites]**: Manages sprites and animations, enhancing the visual content of games.
- **[Ryot Tibia][ryot_tibia]**: Specializes in handling Tibia-specific legacy assets.
- **[Ryot Tiled][ryot_tiled]**: Supports tile-based game development with advanced map editing tools.
- **[Ryot Utils][ryot_utils]**: Provides general utilities and helpers used across the framework.

## Applications
